Title: The Choice of Viral Load End Point in Early Phase Trials of COVID-19 Treatments Aiming to Reduce 28-Day Hospitalization and/or Death.
Journal: The Journal of infectious diseases (2025 Jul 30)
Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Virologic end points are used in phase 2 trials for COVID-19 therapeutics, but they have not been established as surrogates for clinical end points. No meta-analysis using individual participant data (IPD) has been undertaken to identify viral load outcomes for which treatment effects are best associated with effects on hospitalization/death. METHODS: This meta-analysis combined IPD from 23 COVID-19 treatment versus control comparisons to calculate R2, a surrogacy measure quantifying the relationship between the treatment effect on 28-day hospitalization/death and the treatment effect on the surrogate. R2 ranges from 0 to 1, with a strong relationship >/= 0.72, moderate 0.49 < R2 < 0.72, and weak </= 0.49. We estimated R2 for various viral load outcomes at days 3, 5, and 7, including change-from-baseline, slope, average area under the curve minus baseline (AAUCMB), and a change of at least 0.5 log10 copies/mL from baseline to day 3. RESULTS: R 2 was numerically highest for the change-from-baseline to day 3 (0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], .26-.79), slightly lower for change-from-baseline to day 5 (0.49; 95% CI, .24-.75) and numerically lower for change-from-baseline to day 7 (0.40; 95% CI, .15-.65). All were statistically significant. DISCUSSION: Our study is the first to use IPD, allowing us to evaluate viral load collected on various study days as a surrogate to clinical outcomes. Change in log10(viral load) from baseline to day 3 or day 5 are moderate surrogates for 28-day hospitalization/death and suitable primary end points in phase 2 clinical trials and are preferred over change-from-baseline to day 7. Slope and AAUCMB require more calculation but did not improve prediction so are not recommended.

Title: Effect of spirulina on risk of hospitalization among patients with COVID-19: the TOGETHER randomized trial.
Journal: The American journal of clinical nutrition (2024 Sep)
Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Algae-derived nutraceuticals, such as spirulina, have been reported to have biological activities that may minimize clinical consequences to COVID-19 infections. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine whether spirulina is an effective treatment for high-risk patients with early COVID-19 in an outpatient setting. METHODS: The TOGETHER trial is a placebo-controlled, randomized, platform trial conducted in Brazil. Eligible participants were symptomatic adults with a positive rapid test for SARS-CoV-2 older than 50 y or with a known risk factor for disease severity. Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or spirulina (1 g twice daily for 14 d). The primary end point was hospitalization defined as either retention in a COVID-19 emergency setting for >6 h or transfer to tertiary hospital owing to COVID-19 at 28 d. Secondary outcomes included time-to-hospitalization, mortality, and adverse drug reactions. We used a Bayesian framework to compare spirulina with placebo. RESULTS: We recruited 1126 participants, 569 randomly assigned to spirulina and 557 to placebo. The median age was 49.0 y, and 65.3% were female. The primary outcome occurred in 11.2% in the spirulina group and 8.1% in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR]: 1.24; 95% credible interval: 0.84, 1.86). There were no differences in emergency department visit (OR: 1.21; 95% credible interval: 0.81, 1.83), nor time to symptom relief (hazard ratio: 0.90; 95% credible interval: 0.79, 1.03). Spirulina also not demonstrate important treatment effects in the prespecified subgroups defined by age, sex, BMI, days since symptom onset, or vaccination status. CONCLUSIONS: Spirulina has no any clinical benefits as an outpatient therapy for COVID-19 compared with placebo with respect to reducing the retention in an emergency setting or COVID-19-related hospitalization. There are no differences between spirulina and placebo for other secondary outcomes. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04727424.

Title: Matched vs Nonmatched Placebos in a Randomized Trial of COVID-19 Treatments.
Journal: JAMA network open (2024 May 1)
Abstract:
IMPORTANCE: Matched placebo interventions are complex and resource intensive. Recent evidence suggests matched placebos may not always be necessary. Previous studies have predominantly evaluated potential bias of nonmatched placebos (ie, differing on dose, frequency of administration, or formulation) in pain and mental health, but to date no systematic examination has been conducted in infectious disease. OBJECTIVE: To test for differences between nonmatched and matched placebo arms with respect to clinical outcome measures across multiple therapeutics for COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a comparative effectiveness research study, a post hoc analysis was conducted of data on individual patients enrolled in a large, multiarm, platform randomized clinical trial in symptomatic adult outpatients with COVID-19 between January 15, 2021, to September 28, 2023, in which the outcomes of both matched and nonmatched placebo groups were reported. Bayesian and frequentist covariate-adjusted techniques were compared with 7 intervention-placebo pairs. EXPOSURES: Seven matched and nonmatched placebo pairs (for a total of 7 comparisons) were evaluated throughout the primary platform trial. Comparisons were made between treatment and its associated matched (concurrent) placebo, as well as with nonmatched placebo (alone and in combination) assessed at a similar time point. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes assessed included hospitalizations, EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-level scores, and PROMIS Global-10 scores. RESULTS: A total of 7 intervention-control pairs (N = 2684) were assessed, including 1620 (60.4%) women, with mean (SD) age, 47 (15.2) years; the most common comorbidities were obesity (41.9%) and hypertension (37.9%). In a meta-analysis with decoupled SEs, accounting for overlapping placebo patients, the overall odds ratio (OR) of nonmatched compared with matched placebo was 1.01 (95% credible interval, 0.77-1.32), with posterior probability of equivalence, defined as 0.8 </= OR </= 1.2 (a deviation from perfect equivalence ie, OR = 1, by no more than 0.2) of 85.4%, implying no significant difference. Unadjusted analysis of the event rate difference between all nonmatched and matched placebo groups did not identify any notable differences across all 7 treatment-placebo combinations assessed. Similar analysis that was conducted for patient-reported quality of life outcomes did not yield statistically significant differences. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this post hoc study of a randomized clinical platform trial, pooling matched and nonmatched placebo patient data did not lead to inconsistencies in treatment effect estimation for any of the investigational drugs. These findings may have significant implications for future platform trials, as the use of nonmatched placebo may improve statistical power, or reduce barriers to placebo implementation.

Title: Adaptive designs in public health: Vaccine and cluster randomized trials go Bayesian.
Journal: Statistics in medicine (2024 Jun 30)
Abstract:
Clinical trials in public health-particularly those conducted in low- and middle-income countries-often involve communicable and non-communicable diseases with high disease burden and unmet needs. Trials conducted in these regions often are faced with resource limitations, so improving the efficiencies of these trials is critical. Adaptive trial designs have the potential to save trial time and resources and reduce the number of patients receiving ineffective interventions. In this paper, we provide a detailed account of the implementation of vaccine and cluster randomized trials within the framework of Bayesian adaptive trials, with emphasis on computational efficiency and flexibility with regard to stopping rules and allocation ratios. We offer an educated approach to selecting prior distributions and a data-driven empirical Bayes method for plug-in estimates for nuisance parameters.

Title: A Long and Reversibly Self-Assembling 1D DNA Nanostructure Built from Triplex and Quadruplex Hybrid Tiles.
Journal: Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English) (2021 Apr 12)
Abstract:
We report a new DNA nanostructure, an extended 1-dimensional composite built for the first time out of structurally robust yet conveniently disassembled DNA triple helices, interspersed with short stretches of G-quadruplexes. These "TQ Hybrid" 1-dimensional nanostructures require potassium ions and modestly acidic pH for their formation and are easily disassembled by changes to either of these requirements. We initially prepared and characterized a "monomeric" TQ Hybrid tile; followed by "sticky" TQs tiles, incorporating unique guanine-only sticky ends, that enable efficient self-assembly via G-quartet formation of nanostructures >150 nm in length, as seen with atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. We anticipate that such DNA TQ Hybrid structures will find unique and varied application as communication modules within larger nanostructures, and as sensors, logic gates, as well as in other aspects of DNA nanotechnology.

Title: CLICK-17, a DNA enzyme that harnesses ultra-low concentrations of either Cu+ or Cu2+ to catalyze the azide-alkyne 'click' reaction in water.
Journal: Nucleic acids research (2020 Jul 27)
Abstract:
To enable the optimal, biocompatible and non-destructive application of the highly useful copper (Cu+)-mediated alkyne-azide 'click' cycloaddition in water, we have isolated and characterized a 79-nucleotide DNA enzyme or DNAzyme, 'CLICK-17', that harnesses as low as sub-micromolar Cu+; or, surprisingly, Cu2+ (without added reductants such as ascorbate) to catalyze conjugation between a variety of alkyne and azide substrates, including small molecules, proteins and nucleic acids. CLICK-17's Cu+ catalysis is orders of magnitude faster than that of either Cu+ alone or of Cu+ complexed to PERMUT-17, a sequence-permuted DNA isomer of CLICK-17. With the less toxic Cu2+, CLICK-17 attains rates comparable to Cu+, under conditions where both Cu2+ alone and Cu2+ complexed with a classic accelerating ligand, THPTA, are wholly inactive. Cyclic voltammetry shows that CLICK-17, unlike PERMUT-17, powerfully perturbs the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox potential. CLICK-17 thus provides a unique, DNA-derived ligand environment for catalytic copper within its active site. As a bona fide Cu2+-driven enzyme, with potential for being evolved to accept only designated substrates, CLICK-17 and future variants promise the fast, safe, and substrate-specific catalysis of 'click' bioconjugations, potentially on the surfaces of living cells.

Title: High specificity and tight spatial restriction of self-biotinylation by DNA and RNA G-Quadruplexes complexed in vitro and in vivo with Heme.
Journal: Nucleic acids research (2020 Jun 4)
Abstract:
Guanine-rich, single-stranded DNAs and RNAs that fold to G-quadruplexes (GQs) are able to complex tightly with heme and display strongly enhanced peroxidase activity. Phenolic compounds are particularly good substrates for these oxidative DNAzymes and ribozymes; we recently showed that the use of biotin-tyramide as substrate can lead to efficient GQ self-biotinylation. Such biotinylated GQs are amenable to polymerase chain reaction amplification and should be useful for a relatively non-perturbative investigation of GQs as well as GQ-heme complexes within living cells. Here, we report that in mixed solutions of GQ and duplex DNA in vitro, GQ biotinylation is specifically >104-fold that of the duplex, even in highly concentrated DNA gels; that a three-quartet GQ is tagged by up to four biotins, whose attachment occurs more or less uniformly along the GQ but doesn't extend significantly into a duplex appended to the GQ. This self-biotinylation can be modulated or even abolished in the presence of strong GQ ligands that compete with heme. Finally, we report strong evidence for the successful use of this methodology for labeling DNA and RNA within live, freshly dissected Drosophila larval salivary glands.

Title: Genome-wide discovery of somatic regulatory variants in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Journal: Nature communications (2018 Oct 1)
Abstract:
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive cancer originating from mature B-cells. Prognosis is strongly associated with molecular subgroup, although the driver mutations that distinguish the two main subgroups remain poorly defined. Through an integrative analysis of whole genomes, exomes, and transcriptomes, we have uncovered genes and non-coding loci that are commonly mutated in DLBCL. Our analysis has identified novel cis-regulatory sites, and implicates recurrent mutations in the 3' UTR of NFKBIZ as a novel mechanism of oncogene deregulation and NF-kappaB pathway activation in the activated B-cell (ABC) subgroup. Small amplifications associated with over-expression of FCGR2B (the Fcgamma receptor protein IIB), primarily in the germinal centre B-cell (GCB) subgroup, correlate with poor patient outcomes suggestive of a novel oncogene. These results expand the list of subgroup driver mutations that may facilitate implementation of improved diagnostic assays and could offer new avenues for the development of targeted therapeutics.

Title: (C2G4)n repeat expansion sequences from the C9orf72 gene form an unusual DNA higher-order structure in the pH range of 5-6.
Journal: PloS one (2018)
Abstract:
Massive expansion of a DNA hexanucleotide sequence repeat (C2G4) within the human C9orf72 gene has been linked to a number of neurodegenerative diseases. In sodium or potassium salt solutions, single-stranded d(C2G4)n DNAs fold to form G-quadruplexes. We have found that in magnesium or lithium salt solutions, especially under slightly acidic conditions, d(C2G4)n oligonucleotides fold to form a distinctive higher order structure whose most striking feature is an "inverted" circular dichroism spectrum, which is distinguishable from the spectrum of the left handed DNA double-helix, Z-DNA. On the basis of CD spectroscopy, gel mobility as well as chemical protection analysis, we propose that this structure, which we call "iCD-DNA", may be a left-handed Hoogsteen base-paired duplex, an unorthodox G-quadruplex/i-motif composite, or a non-canonical, "braided" DNA triplex. Given that iCD-DNA forms under slightly acidic solution conditions, we do not know at this point in time whether or not it forms within living cells.
