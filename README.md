**Session Overview**
This session introduces participants to Python programming through biological and bioinformatics examples. The workshop is structured to build progressively—from Python fundamentals to practical bioinformatics and cheminformatics analysis using Biopython and RDKit. Each segment includes interactive coding, short exercises, and a mini integrated project designed to reinforce learning.
